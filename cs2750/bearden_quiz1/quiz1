My name is Josh Bearden, I'm in my last 3 semesters here at UMSL. I have spent some time at Truman State university and transferred here to UMSL.

I am expecting to cement my skills with UNIX in this course, I have some experience with linux and command line interfaces from my time at Truman, but my skills are getting rusty.

I have experience with Ada, Java, C, C++, some Python, some HTML, Javascript and PHP, and a lot of experience with Emacs as opposed to Vi, but I have not been able to use Emacs on Delmar, unfortunately.
